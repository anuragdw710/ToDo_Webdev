# ToDo_Webdev
Since the tech-stacks are growing day by day, the frameworks are constantly evolving. The latest framework that has been the developers' choice for backend is Adonis.js. In the project we will walk through creating CRUD APIs with help of Adonis.js and will also learn HTTP, REST API. Here we will build backend APIs for a todo web app and will test the APIs with help of Postman.
